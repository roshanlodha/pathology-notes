# Thyroid Disorders
Generally, all thyroid disorders fall into one of three categories:
1. hyperthyroid
2. hypothyroid
3. thyroiditis
Thyroiditis can cause both hyperthyroid and hypothyroid symptoms. During initial inflamation, the tyroid hormone within the gland will spill into blood, leading to hyperthyroidism. Eventually, the inflamation will decrease production of thyroid hormone within the gland, leading to long term hypothyroidism. 

## Hypothyroidism
Symptoms of hypothyroidism are all resultant of decreased metabolism. Specifically, everything slows down: 
* lethargy, fatigue
* weakness, dyspnea on exertion
* cold intolerance
* weight gain with loss of appetite
* constipation
* hyporeflexia on neurological examination
* dry, cool skin
* coarse, brittle hair 
* bradycardia 

### Myxedema
Myxedema (thyroid demopathy) is a non-pitting edema of the skin from hypothyroidism. It is caused by hyaluronic acid that deposits in the dermin which draws water out, leading to swelling, usually in the face or periorbital region. <i>However, a subset of myxedema known as pretibial myxedema occurs in over the skin, which is seen in Grave's disease, a form of hyperthyroidism.</i> Myxedema coma is a coma derived from hypothyroidism. 

### Hypothyroid Myopathy
Muscle symptoms are common in hypothyroid patients. Hypothyroid patients are often weak and present with cramps or myalgias (pain the muscles). <b> Sreum creatinine kinase (CK) levels can rise in patients with hypothyroid myopathy.</b>

### Hyponatremia
Hypothyroidism is a well known cause of decrease Na levels via high levels of ADH (i.e. SIADH syndrome). This can lead to confusion. 

### Thyroid Replacement
Synthetic thyroid hormones can treat thyroidism.
* levothyroxine, or <b>synthroid</b> is a T4 analog. 
* liothyronine, or <b>cytomel</b> is a T3 analog. 
Levothyroxine is preffered, as T3 is rapidly absorbed in the small intestine, leading to mild hyperthyroidism symptoms, including tachycardia and tremor. Additionally, T4 can be converted to T3 entrinsically. In practice, dosage is titrate until the TSH is normal. 

## Hyperthyroidism
Symptoms of hyperthyroidism are all resultant of increased metabolism, basically the opposite of hypothyroidism. Specifically, everything speeds up: 
* hyperactivity
* heat intolerance
* weight loss with increased appetite
* diarrhea
* hyperreflexia on neurological examination
* warm, moise skin
* fine hair 
* tachycardia, leading to atrial fibrilation. 
When patients present with acute onset a-fib, it is important to check for hyperthyroidism.<br>
Common hyperthyroid disorders include:
1. Grave's disease (most common cause)
2. toxic multinodular goiter
3. amiodarone
4. iodine load
5. early thyroiditis

### Thyroid Storm
Thyroid storm is a life-threatening hyperthyroidism, or a thyrotoxicosis. It is usually precipitated by some acute event in a patient with a pre-existing hyperthyroid disease, such as Grave's or toxic multinodular goiter. Following a surgery, trauma, or infection, there is a massive increase in thyroid hormone. Following the truama, the patients become sick due to a massive catecholamine surge. They develop fever and delirium, and can have tachycardia extending to death from an arrhythmia. They often also develop hyperglycemia, as the catecholamines and thyroid hormones work in tandem to increase plasma glucose, and hypercalcemia, as hyperthyroidism leads to high turnover of bones.

Treatment of idiopathic thyroid storms starts with propranalol as it treats tachycardia and is a weak blocker of T4 to T3 conversion coupled with thionamides. Additionally, a saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) is administered to increase iodide load and shut off T4 production via the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. Finally, steroids are administered to reduce the T4 to T3 conversion and suppress auto-immune damage (e.g. in Grave's). Patients who have hyperthyroidism may also deplete their adrenal gland, and steroids can work to treat concomitant adrenal insufficiency.

### Goiter
A goiter is an enlarged thyroid that occurs from a high level of TSH coupled with an inability to produce T3 and T4. This leads to a positive feedback loop where the pituitary increases TSH to increase thyroid size to compensate for diminished T3 and T4. This is often seen in an Iodine deficiancy in third-world countries. This can also occur in patients who have thyroid stimulating antibodies, such as in Grave's disease. 

### Grave's Disease
Grave's disease is an autoimmune disorder in which thyroid stimulating antibodies are produced that function similarly to TSH, leading to symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Grave's disease is hallmarked by two unique clinial signs beyond symptoms of hyperthyroidism:
1. exophthalmos (bulging of the eyes) coupled with proptosis (protrusion of the eye) and periorbital edema
	- patients do not present with ocular symptoms 
2. pretibial myxedema 
These two findings occur due to T-cell lympocute activation of fibroblasts, as fibroblasts also contain the TSH receptor. The stimulation leads to secretion of of glycosaminoglycans, which are mostly hydrophilic substances (e.g. hyaluronic acid). Glycosaminoglycans draw in water, leading to non-pitting edema and general swelling. <br>
Treatment of Grave's usually starts with the symptoms (beta blockers for heart symptoms and thionamindes to inhibit thyroid production) to make a patient feel better. Definitive treatment involves surgical or radiological ablation of the thyroid gland via radioactive iodine followed by thyroid replacement therapy for the remainder of the patient's life. 

#### Thionamides
The two most common thyroid hormone production inhibitors are:
1. Methimazole, which inhibits TPO (thyroid peroxidase), blunting both the:
	-organification of iodone and 
	-coupling of MIT and DIT 
2. Propylthiouracil (PUT), which inhibits TPO and 5'-deiodinase, blunting the peripheral conversion of T4 into the more potent T3. 
Both of these drugs can cause a skin rash. A rare complication is agranulocytosis, or a drop in WBC count. This presents with a fever or infection after starting a drug with an increase in WBC count following stopping of the drug. In a minority of cases, this can lead to alastic anemia being developed. Both drugs are also associated with hepatotoxicity. <br>
Methimaole is a teratogen, and thus associated with congenital malformations especially when taken in the first trimester. Thus, PTU is often used during early pregnancy in women who are hyperthyroid. 

#### Grave's Ophthalmopathy 
Treatment of Grave's may not improve, and can even worsen, eye symptoms. There can be irritation, excessive tearing, and pain of the eyes which is worsened by cold air, wind, and bright lights. Severe eye symptoms are specially treated via:
* steroids
* radiation
* surgery

## Lab Findings
The best initial test for a thyroid disorder is a TSH. Plasma T3 and T4 levels are fluctuating, thus TSH provides a more robust measurements of what the tissues are seeing. <br>
Most thyroid disorders are called "primary disorders," meaning the disorder is within the thyroid gland itself. The thyroid is either overproducing or underproducing thyroid hormone, and the pituitary gland is modifying TSH levels to compensate. Thus, TSH levels are always opposite the thyroid hormone level:
* hypothyroidism := high TSH with low T3 and T4
* hyperthyroidism := low TSH with high T3 and T4
A minority of patients may present with "central disease," meaning that the thyroid gland is normal but the pituitary gland is undersecreting or oversecreting TSH. In this case, patients present with proportional levels of TSH and thyroid hormone. Usually, these diseases are caused by hypothalamic-pituitary axis tumors which can block the secretion of TRH or TSH, leading to hypothyroidism. These tumors can sometimes produce TSH (i.e. TSHoma), leading to hyperthyroidism. <br>
In pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone, the negative feedback between thyroid hormone and the pituitary is ablated, leading to over production of thyroid hormone via undiminished TSH production, or hyperthyroidism. 

### Reverse T3
Reverse T3, an isomer of T3, is formed intrinsically from T4. Levels of reverse T3 usually parallel levels of T4. rT3 has a special use in diagnosis of <b>euthyroid sick syndrome</b>, in which critically ill patients present with a low TSH and low T3 and T4. While this looks like central hypothyroidism, the underlying disease is a derivative of increased rT3 due to impaired clearance. Thus, in patients presenting with low TSH, T3, and T4, a low rT3 indicates a central hypothyroidism (e.g. tumor), while a high rT3 indicated sick euthyroid syndrome. Treating the critical illness will cause the sick euthyroid syndrome to go away. 

### Grave's Disease
Grave's disease presents with hyperthyroid labs coupled with exophthalmos. Elevated direct measurement of thyroid stimulating antiglobulins (TSH receptor antibodies) also suggests Grave's.
