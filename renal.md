# Glomerular Diseases
Normally, the glomerulus whats to allow filteration of water, electrolytes, glucose, and amino acids into the Bowman's space. Importantly, it wasts to prevent filteration of most proteins and red blood cells. Thus, glomerular pathologies involve proteinuria or hematuria. To reach the Bowman's capsule, filtrates must cross the glomerular filteration barrier, which includes:

1. Capillary endothelium
	- fenestrated (has holes) that allow for 40 nm molecules to pass through
	- repels red cells, white cells, and platlets
	- first barrier to filteration 
	- essentially keeps out all cells
2. Basement membrane
	- made of negatively charged type IV collagen and heparan sulfate
	- repels negatively charged molecules like albumin and is a 4 nm size barrier
3. Podocytes (epithelium)
	- have processes that wrap around capillaries
	- the space between the processes filter blood for particples smaller than 4 nm

All glomerular diseases are caused by the breakdown of the filteration barrier at some level.

## Hematuria
Hematuria is the presence of RBCs in urine. This is detected by urinalysis via either a dipstick (heme's peroxidase reacts with the strip) of microscopy (the cells are visualized). The dipstick can also be present in rhabdomyolysis, or the presence of myoglobin in the urine. 

Hematuria can have many causes. It can be gross (abnormal urine color) or microscopic (only found via urinalysis). It can occur naturally after exercise but common causes include:
* UTI's
* Kidney Stones

The most feared cause is bladder cancer, but glomerular disease is a rare cause. Patients with glomerular disease will also present with <b>red cell casts</b> and protein in the urine. Red cell cases are caused when RBCs are pushed into the nephron, which leads to them bunching up and causing "casts". For the same reason, glomerular bleeding can cause dysmorphic RBCs, acanthocytes (RBCs with spiked cell membrane), "coca cola" colored urine, and generally do not present with clots. 

## Proteinuria
Protein (primarily albumin) in the urine is also detected via the dipstick. This can be biased by urine concentration. To account for this, you can take the protein:creatinine ratio from the 1st or 2nd morning sample of urine after avoiding exercise. The best way is to do a 24-hour urine collection. 

## Nephrotic Syndromes
Filteration barrier to proteins is lost but the RBCs are still filtered (i.e. capillary endothelium is still intact). This leads to massive proteinuria.
